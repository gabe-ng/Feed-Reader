<h2>Feed Reader Testing
<h4>About</h4>

This project focuses on test-driven javascript programming. Given starter code for a functioning feed reader application, I created a series of test suites using the Jasmine testing framework. 

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

 - Learn more about Jasmine's framework [here](https://jasmine.github.io/).
 - To store and open the application locally, clone or download the files in the [repository](https://github.com/gabe-ng/Feed-Reader) and open the index.html in your browser.
 
 
<h4>Writing Your Own Tests</h4>

 - If you would like to tinker with the functionality of the app, feel free to add your changes in the app.js file.
 - Afterwards, if you would like to write your own tests to run, you can write them in the feedreader.js file located under the spec subfolder of the jasmine folder.
